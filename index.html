            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                All my life, I have been fascinated by technology. Since I was young, I have loved playing video
                games, spending time on the internet, and working with anything digital.
            </p>
            <p>
                After high school, I worked many jobs. I had jumped between many blue collared positions and even
                spent three years in the infantry with the Canadian Forces. The entire time, I had been left feeling
                unfulfilled.
            </p>
            <p>
                After my three year contract with the army expired, I decided it was time for a change. I knew that
                I needed to pursue a career that I could be passionate about. I began programming and fell in love with
                it shortly after. The freedom to build and create whatever my mind desired was an exciting experience.
                Automating tedious tasks and building simple games became a hobby. The eureka moment that came when
                creating the perfect algorithm to solve a problem was so satisfying. Trying to create better, more
                flexible, and extensible code became an obsession of mine. I knew that I found what I wanted to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience as a developer is still in its early stages, but I continue to grow and expand my
                knowledge every day. I plan to keep developing my skills throughout my entire career. Becoming an
                absolute master at programming is one of my biggest dreams and aspirations in life.
