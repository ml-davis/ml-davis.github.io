            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                All my life, I have been fascinated by technology. Since I was young, I have loved playing video
                games, spending time on the internet, and working with anything digital.
            </p>
            <p>
                After high school, I worked many jobs. I had jumped between many blue collared positions and even
                spent three years in the infantry with the Canadian Forces. The entire time, I had been left feeling
                unfulfilled.
            </p>
            <p>
                After my three year contract with the army expired, I decided it was time for a change. I knew that
                I needed to pursue a career that I could be passionate about. I began programming. I fell in love with
                it shortly after. The freedom to build and create whatever my mind desired was an exciting experience. 
                Automating tedious tasks and building simple games became a hobby. The eureka moment that came when 
                creating the perfect algorithm to solve a problem was so satisfying. Trying to create better, more 
                flexible, and extensible code became an obsession of mine. I knew that I found what I wanted to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience as a developer is still in its early stages, but I continue to grow and expand my 
                knowledge every day. I plan to keep developing my skills throughout my entire career. Becoming an 
                absolute master developer is one my biggest dreams and aspirations.
